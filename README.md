adx-site-check-ce

This is a Chrome extension created to automate some of the checks for proper setup of tags, divs and scripts on a site required for displaying of ads.

It has an additional feature to highlight all ad units on a page coloring them and providing a on click listener to toggle different sizes od the ad unit.

Information is stored using storage API and all errors regarding individual ad units are display in the extension popup window.

One of my first project so totaly laughable by a proper dev. :)
