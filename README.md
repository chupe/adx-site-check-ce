adx-site-check-ce

This is a Chrome extension created to automate some of the checks for proper setup required for displaying of GPT tags.

It goes trough the GPT tags, divs and proprietary (Lupon Media) script on the site.

It has an additional feature to highlight all ad units on the page coloring them and providing ability to swiftly check all the sizes by clicking.

Information is stored using storage API and all errors regarding individual ad units are display in the extension popup window.

Storage details can be displayed in the popup.

One of my first project so totaly laughable by a proper dev. :)
